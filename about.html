    <h1>What About CJ?</h1>
    <p>So, what about CJ hm? My name is Carlos Jamerson Jr., giving me the nickname CJ, but for most my online and creative ventures I go by True Discord. I'm an African American male from Tennessee; and I'm currently 24. I consider myself an intellectual and love debates and philosophical/hypothetical conversations. If you'd like to know more about me, feel free to ask :) </p>
    <p>My main career asperations are to become a fulltime artist/musician/or game creator. With that being said, it should be no suprise I'm quite the creative, but I also have a big heart and am an opprotunist on occasion. I'm learning coding because it has the possibility of not only letting me earn the money needed to pursue my more creative ventures, but also could very well come in handy for said ventures in it's own right.</p>
    <p>My favorite foods have not changed much for my whole life. Pizza, Just about any form of chicken, Burgers, and Spagetti. In this case the apple doesn't fall far from the tree; speaking of which, apples are my favorite fruit.</p>
